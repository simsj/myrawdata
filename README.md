# What's In My Raw Data?
This project is intended to provide the curious genetic genealogist with some basic information about the contents of raw data files customers of 23AndMe, AncestryDNA and Family Tree DNA can download from these direct-to-consumer DNA testing for ancestry vendors.  An exploratory data analysis is provided.

This information is also part of the Supplemental Information for an article titled Autosomal DNA Part 3 in *Acorns to Oaks* 38(2), the quarterly publication of the Oakland County Genealogical Society (Michigan, ocgsmi.org) manuscript in preparation.
